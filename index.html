    <h1>Major-General's Song</h1>
    <h2>Gilbert & Sullivan (1879)</h2>
    
    <p>I am the very model of a modern Major-General, <br>
       I've information vegetable, animal, and mineral, <br>
       I know the kings of England, and I quote the fights historical, <br>
       From Marathon to Waterloo, in order categorical...</p>
    
    <p>I'm very good at integral and differential calculus; <br>
       I know the scientific names of beings animalculous: <br>
       In short, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral, <br>
       I am the very model of a modern Major-Gineral.</p>
    
    <p>I know our mythic history, King Arthur's and Sir Caradoc's; <br>
       I answer hard acrostics, I've a pretty taste for paradox, <br>
       I quote in elegiacs all the crimes of Heliogabalus, <br>
       In conics I can floor peculiarities parabolous...</p>
    
    <p>Then I can write a washing bill in Babylonic cuneiform, <br>
       And tell you ev'ry detail of Caractacus's uniform: <br>
       In short, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral, <br>
       I am the very model of a modern Major-Gineral.</p>
    
    <p>In fact, when I know what is meant by "mamelon" and "ravelin", <br>
       When I can tell at sight a Mauser rifle from a javelin, <br>
       When such affairs as sorties and surprises I'm more wary at, <br>
       And when I know precisely what is meant by "commissariat"...</p>
